                        <h2>What are the clothes out of? </h2>
                        <h3>Fabric is categorized in two main categories: natural and synthetic.</h3>
                        <h2>What are synthetic materials?</h2>
                        <h3>These are man-made fibers, artificial fibers such as polyester, nylon, acrylic etc. Think of your favorite pair of yoga pants! 
                            Those are made from synthetic materials.</h3>
                        <h2>Why do people use synthetic over natural fibers?</h2>
                        <h3>It’s cheaper and more durable! Not only that, they often are waterproof and stain resistant.</h3>

                        <h3>Once a design is sent off to production, the fabric mills start knitting the fabric, then it is sent to the dyeing mill.  Once the fabric is finished, it is shipped to the factory to start making the clothes! When all garments are sewn and packed, they are shipped out to a warehouse, then to you!</h3>
                        <h2>How does manufacturing effect the environment?</h2>
                        <h3>The fashion industry is known for being one of the most polluting industries and accounts for about 10% of the annual global carbon emission. Not only that, water pollution is a huge issue in the dyeing process. This wastewater can contain toxic substances that is not only bad for marine wildlife, but also to humans as mills often directly dump the water back into the rivers.</h3>

                        <h3>Synthetic materials release thousands of tiny plastic fibers called microplastics with every wash. Because our washing machines don’t have filters that are fine enough to catch these fibers, about 40% of go directly into our water system, feeding our marine wild life.</h3>
                        <h2>So are certain fabrics worse than others?</h2>
                        <h3>Yes! Studies have found that polyester and acrylic fibers are more likely to shed, but blends are slightly better. Some items  like polyester fleece release  over one million fibers with every wash! That’s seems like an insane amount right!</h3>

                        <h3>1. When shopping for clothes, try second hand first! If you prefer buying new, consider materials made of natural fibers! Even natural blends are better than just 100% synthetic.<br>2. When washing your clothes, consider using a washing bag which helps to trap those hard to catch fibers before it can get into our water system. Save those fish!<br>3. When you’re in the mood to purge your wardrobe, start by asking friends to see if they are interested. If not, think about donating them to your local second hand store or any non-profit that might be interested! Try not to throw it in the trash because it will just end up in landfills.<br>Finally, just being aware of these issues and sharing them with your friend can help to significantly. Be the change! </h3>
